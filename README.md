# Robopong
A javascript pong game I use to test JS machine learning 

NOTE At this time there isn't actually any ML running on this program, as all my training data has failed spectacularly. At this time this is just a simple JS pong game using P5, Webpack, and Node. 

# I want to run this on my machine 

You can run this program on your machine with the following commands. This requires NodeJS and NPM, which can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

``` 
//clone and call this directory
git clone https://github.com/mikepawlak/robopong && cd robopong

//start program
npm run serve

//the Pong page is now being served on localhost:8080
```
